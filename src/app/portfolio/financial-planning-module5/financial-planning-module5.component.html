										Among the downsides of using cash only:<br><br>
										» There’s no built-in proof of payment if things go wrong.<br>
										» It’s tempting to waste cash on lots of small, silly purchases—leaving you broke
										and wondering “Where did it all go?” when it’s time to pay the bills.<br>
										» Once cash is lost or stolen, it’s gone for good.<br><br>
										Credit cards aren’t always the best choice either. That’s especially true considering
										the fact that the interest paid on borrowed money has the potential to mushroom
										into a mountain of debt if you’re not careful. (You can learn more about credit
										cards in Module 2: Borrowing.) Luckily, there are plenty more ways to spend and
										receive money.<br><br>
										Other than using cash, how do you or family members exchange

									<p class="paragraph">
										The center of most people’s daily financial lives is a bank* account.<br><br>
										If you completed activities in Module 4: Saving & Investing, you learned about a
										few types of bank accounts. Savings accounts, money markets accounts, and
										certificates of deposit can help you safely stash your cash for things that are truly
										important to you. And earning interest on your savings grows your money faster
										over time.<br><br>
										But <b>savings accounts don’t work for everyday spending.</b> Federal regulations
										limit account holders to no more than six withdrawals from a savings (or money
										market) account each month. And keeping all your money in one account makes it
										too easy to tap into and drain the funds you were saving for a car, school, or other
										financial goals.<br><br>
										So, you need a second bank account to handle your bills and daily expenses.<br><br>

										Even if you never write a check, a <b>checking account</b> will keep your money safe
										while allowing you to access it several different ways.<br><br>
										<b>A check is a written order telling the bank who to pay and how much.</b> Signing
										your name at the bottom means you agree to pay the amount “on demand,” or as
										soon as the person you’ve written the check to (aka the <b>payee</b>) deposits

							</div>

							<div class="col-12 mt-3 mb-5">
									<p class="paragraph">
										<b>+ Convenience of Mailing.</b> Dropping a check in the mail is less hassle than
										standing in line to pay with cash or get a money order.<br><br>
										<b>+ Proof of Payment.</b> Your cleared check serves as proof of payment for goods,
										services, and charitable donations.<br><br>
										<b>+ Safety.</b> Lost or stolen checks can be replaced. You also can request a
										stop-payment order to prevent a check of yours from being cashed in cases of
										suspected theft or if you realize the check was written in error.<br><br>
										<b>+ Debit Card Backup.</b> Write a check to yourself and get cash from a bank.<br><br>
										<b>+ Direct Deposit.</b> In some cases, you’ll need to provide your employer with a
										voided blank check from your account to enroll in automatic deposit, in which
										your paycheck is electronically deposited into your account.<br><br>
										<b>+ Ease of Tracking.</b> Recording transactions in a check register makes it easy to
										track your spending.<br><br>
										<b>+ Interest.</b> Some checking accounts pay interest on your average balance.

										bottom of a paper check:<br><br>
										» <b>Bank Routing Number.</b> The unique nine-digit number telling the payee’s bank
										which bank to get the money from. It’s found between the symbols, shown

								<p class="paragraph">
									Occasionally, you may be asked to pay in a way that gives the payee
									confidence that a payment will clear quickly.<br><br>
									<b>Certified Check.</b> The bank verifies that you have the funds in your account
									set aside specifically for the check amount and confirms that your signature
									on the check is genuine. A payee might request this type of check to
									guarantee that your check will clear the bank, especially when you need to
									make a large payment for something such as a car.<br>
									<b>Cashier’s Check.</b> The bank deducts the amount from your account and writes
									the check on its own funds. This is another way for the payee to ensure that
									the check is good. Another instance in which you might use this is when you
									close a bank account. Taking the closing balance as a cashier’s check is safer
									than carrying around a big wad of cash.<br><br>
									<b>Wire Transfer.</b> You can immediately transfer funds from your account to
									another person’s account in different cities or countries without even writing
									a check.<br><br>
									These types of payments are available from a bank teller for a fee.

										Jason says to his dad, “My account was already negative when I went to the fastfood
										place! Why didn’t they just turn down my debit card?”<br><br>
										“Ironically, they call it <b>overdraft protection.</b> The bank offers you the option for
										protection from having your card declined,” his dad explains, adding, “but you pay
										for it big time.”<br><br>
										“What if I don’t want them to do that anymore?” Jason asks.<br><br>
										“Just tell them you want to opt out of overdraft protection. Of course, you might
										be stuck at the register without a way to pay next time,” his dad reminds him.<br><br>
										“That’s OK,” Jason says. “I’d much rather be turned down than pay another $30 fee
										for a $9 burger and fries!”<br><br>
										Jason’s dad explains, “You may have forgotten that you chose to opt-in for
										overdraft protection. You gave the bank permission to cover the amount of your
										purchase that is more than what is in your account. This services comes with a fee.”<br><br>
										Without overdraft protection, it may be embarrassing to have your card declined
										when you don’t have enough money in your account, but it doesn’t cost you a

										That’s why many people use a <b>restrictive endorsement.</b> This means writing “For
										Deposit Only” and your bank account number with your signature. That way if you
										lose the check, the finder can’t get at the money because the check can only be
										deposited into the account of the payee named on the check.<br><br>
										Usually, you can cash a check for free at your own bank. Simply endorse and hand
										it to the teller. You also may be able to cash it for free or a small fee at the bank
										listed on the check. Depending on the amount of the check, you may not have
										immediate access to the money until the bank knows the check will clear.<br><br>
										<b>Don’t Wait.</b> Banks can refuse to honor checks that are more than six months old.
										Some checks have an even shorter time period printed on them (for example, “Not
										valid after 90 days from date issued”). A delay in cashing can frustrate whoever
										wrote out the check to you, because it throws off that person’s account balance.<br><br>
										Don’t lose out on money payable to you—deposit
										checks soon after you get them!<br><br>
										<b>Bank Holds.</b> Banks hold deposited checks to reduce their risk of cashing a bad
										check. If there’s a hold, the money usually won’t be available until the next
										business day. If it’s a big check or from an out-of-state bank, your money or a
										portion of the deposit may be held for several days. For new-account customers,
										the delay can be as long as nine business days.

										Here’s the scoop on how to reconcile your account:<br><br>
										1. Go through your statement and check off each transaction in your register—
										making sure the amounts match, too.<br><br>
										2. In your register, subtract any bank fees and/or add any interest earned.<br><br>
										3. On a separate sheet of paper, take the ending balance on the bank
										statement, and add any deposits you made that the bank didn’t post yet.<br><br>
										4. From that amount, subtract any payments and withdrawals you made that
										weren’t listed on your statement yet.<br><br>
										5. What’s the total? If the adjusted bank statement balance matches your
										register balance, congratulations! You’re done.<br><br>
										6. If it doesn’t, figure out what the difference is. Then compare the transactions
										between your register and the statement to find where you might have
										miscalculated in your register or inaccurately recorded a transaction.<br><br>
										7. Once you find the error, make the adjustment in your register and you’re done!

										<b>Gift Cards or Reloadable Cards</b><br>
										Prepaid cards have soared in popularity in recent years, with issuers marketing
										them as an alternative to both credit cards and bank accounts. But are they really a
										good choice?<br><br>
										If you’ve used a <b>gift card</b> before, you’ve used a prepaid card. Of course, many gift
										cards are good only at a certain store or restaurant. And once the money is spent,
										the card is worthless.<br><br>
										The big buzz these days is about <b>general purpose reloadable (GPR)</b> cards
										(aka prepaid debit cards). These are good nearly anywhere that debit cards are
										accepted, including ATMs.<br><br>
										Unlike gift cards, GPR cards have an account number to permanently link that card
										to you. And when the balance hits zero, you can reload the card by adding money
										to the balance.<br><br>
										<b>Pros</b><br>
										+ <b>Convenience.</b> Shop online, pay bills, and avoid carrying around lots of cash.<br>
										+ <b>No Overspending.</b> Your spending is limited to the amount loaded onto
										the card.<br>
										+ <b>Limited Losses.</b> No drained bank account or damaged credit if the card
										disappears. You lose only the money that’s left on the card. Of course, if you set
										up automatic transfers to reload the card, you’ll need to stop those transfers if
										the card is lost or stolen.<br><br>
										<b>Cons</b><br>
										− <b>Good Luck Comparison Shopping.</b> The absence of laws governing prepaid
										cards means card issuers aren’t required to disclose all fees to card users before
										a card is purchased.<br>
										− <b>Shaky Consumer Protections.</b> Prepaid cards do not have the same
										protections as debit and credit cards. There is no guarantee to investigate
										unauthorized charges or other fraud.

									<p class="paragraph">
										− <b>Spotty FDIC Protection.</b> Few prepaid cards offer direct FDIC insurance.3<br>
										− <b>Doesn’t Help Your Credit Rating.</b> A prepaid card is not used for borrowing
										money, so your responsible use of the card won’t help you build a
										credit rating.<br><br>
										Unless you overdraw your checking account often,
										you’ll probably save money by getting a free or
										low-cost checking account that includes a debit card.4
										But if you must use a prepaid card, do your homework to find the
										features you need with the lowest fees.<br><br>
										<b>Money orders</b> are checks minus the checking account. You pay the full amount
										up front with cash or a debit card withdrawal. The clerk prints a money order
										certificate made out to the business or person you designated as the payee.
										Money orders are available at post offices, banks, and grocery stores.

										money order.<br>
										<b>+ No Overdrafts.</b> Because it’s already paid in full, a money order can’t bounce or
										overdraw your account.<br>
										<b>+ Low, One-time Fee.</b> It shouldn’t cost more than $2 per money order, and many
										places charge less than $1.<br>
										<b>+ Replaceable.</b> Unlike with prepaid cards, lost or stolen money orders will be
										replaced if you show your receipt.

									   <b>Cons</b><br>
										<b>− Limited Funding Options.</b> You can’t use a credit card to buy a money order.
										Sellers accept cash or debit card withdrawal only.<br>
										<b>− Tracking Your Money.</b> You are responsible for keeping track of the money
										order information. The details of a money order are not reported in a bank
										account statement.<br><br>
										Money orders are handy when you can’t write a check
										and want proof of payment. They’re also a cheaper
										alternative to certified and cashier’s checks.<br><br>
										<b>Getting Friendly with Portal Possibilities</b>
										A payment portal is the payment method of choice of many online shopping sites.
										First, you register your credit card, debit card, or bank account information at the
										portal’s secure website. Then you can direct payment through your portal account
										to the portal accounts of other people, organizations, and businesses. You don’t
										have to provide your financial information each time. The pros and cons can vary
										for the type of portal used.<br><br>
										<b>Pros</b><br>
										<b>+ Extra Barrier of Security.</b> You check out through the portal, so the recipient
										never views or stores your payment information.<br>
										<b>+ Free to You.</b> You pay nothing to use the portal for online purchases. Fees for
										money transfers within the U.S. are free if funded with your bank account.<br>
										<b>+ International Transfers.</b> You can send money to payment portal users in other
										countries. The fees may be less than the cost of a wire transfer.<br>
										<b>+ Easy.</b> For purchases, just select the payment portal from among the options
										offered at checkout. To send money to someone else, all you need is that
										person’s email address.<br>
										<b>+ Consumer Protections.</b> Payment portals are not banks. But they are subject to
										many of the same consumer protection laws as banks. Portals must investigate
										and restore the funds for any unauthorized transactions or errors if you report
										them within 60 days.<br><br>
										<b>Cons</b><br>
										<b>	− Delayed Money.</b> Transferring money to and from your bank account can take
										three business days.<br>
										<b>− Limited Stores.</b> Obviously, you can use a specific portal only at stores that
										offer it as a payment option.

									It’s not a dream! With direct deposit, your paycheck or government benefits are
									there, ready and waiting for you. There’s no picking up a check, making trips to the
									bank, or waiting for a check to clear.<br><br>
									Employers like direct deposit because it saves them time and money and
									eliminates the possibility of paycheck theft. In short, direct deposit is an employer
									offer you shouldn’t refuse!<br><br>
									<b>Automatic Deposits and Transfers</b><br>
									It’s a cinch to pay yourself first (PYF) with “set it and forget it” services like
									<b>automatic transfers</b> and automatic deposits.<br><br>
									Basically, automatic transfers let you schedule money movements between
									accounts at the same bank. Automatic deposits let you schedule regular transfers
									from an outside bank to your bank and finally to your account. Either service
									provides an opportunity for you to consistently build your savings and never miss
									a day of interest!<br><br>
									<b>Online Bill Pay</b><br>
									Online bill pay lets you send money to your creditors and utilities straight from
									your checking account or savings account. Make a one-time payment or schedule
									payments to happen automatically each month. Some prepaid debit cards offer
									online bill pay, too.<br><br>
									You do have to plan ahead, as payments can take two to five business days to
									process. But overall, online bill pay saves you time and stamps. It helps prevent
									late-payment fees. And it keeps your financial information safer, because it’s not
									sitting in a mailbox or out in the open on someone’s desk.

									contact first. Keep your Social Security card in a secure place.<br><br>
									2. <b>Keep PINs totally under wraps.</b> Don’t give them to friends, write them on

									to date, not just your operating system. And don’t download anything you
									didn’t go looking for in the first place.<br><br>
									5. <b>Be skeptical of any offers.</b> Your computer does not need a free security
