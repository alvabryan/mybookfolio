								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										Kevin’s been planning to work while in college anyway, so he wonders if he could
										somehow knock off two birds with one stone. An ad for an emergency medical
										technician (EMT) catches Kevin’s attention. He’d only need a semester’s worth of
										training to get certified and licensed. And because EMT hours aren’t strictly 9
										a.m.
										to 5 p.m., it might be easy to arrange his work schedule around his college
										classes.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										He does a little digging online and learns that an average wage for EMTs is more
										than $14 an hour. That’s a lot more than he’d earn working in a retail store or
										restaurant. And, hopefully, it would be enough so that he could avoid taking out
										any student loans until medical school.

									<h3 class="floatLeft mt-3">CLIMBING THE EDUCATION LADDER</h3>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										While you can take any job to put yourself through college, you’ll maximize the
										benefits by taking a more strategic <b>education ladder</b> approach, like the
										one Kevin
										is planning.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										Start by finding the shortest training that qualifies you for entry-level jobs
										that pay
										well in a field that interests you. Complete the training and then use that job
										to
										help you pay your way through a two-year or four-year degree.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										Use your new degree to move into a higher-paying job in your field. In some

									<h3 class="floatLeft mt-3">THE MID-STREAM COLLEGE UPGRADE</h3>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										If your heart is set on getting a degree from your dream college, one savings
										strategy is to start your college career at a community or public four-year
										college
										close to home. Your first two years are usually spent completing core courses
										anyway, which tend to be similar from campus to campus. You’ll still be able to
										complete your major at your first-choice college once you transfer.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3 mb-5">
									<p class="paragraph">
										It can’t be stressed enough, though—you MUST make sure the four-year college
										will accept the credits you earn elsewhere. Finding out later that most of your
										credits won’t transfer will wipe out any savings.

										In fact, someone with a bachelor’s degree ends up earning $21,900 more than

										Working can make money for you, but it can cost you money, too! Here are some
										typical extra expenses that go along with working:<br><br>
										» Transportation—bus fare or gas, parking, and a car to get to and from work<br>
										» Clothing—uniforms or business attire, plus any dry cleaning<br>
										» Memberships—such as union dues or fees to professional associations<br>
										» Supplies—tools or equipment you’re required to buy for your job<br>
										» Child care—day care or kids’ after-school programs for when you’re not
										home<br><br>
										Note that some of the costs—such as transportation—are ones you’ll have for
										pretty much any job. And some will vary by the job. For example, if the new
										company you’re considering working for is located an additional 45 minutes
										away, increased transportation and child-care costs could eat up the advantage
										of
										earning slightly higher pay.<br><br>
										You’ll spend many of your waking hours working. So, it’s well worth your time to
										carefully weigh all the pros and cons before saying yes to a particular job
										offer.

										To speed up your trip to the top, you need to focus on what your supervisor
										wants
										instead of what you want. Raises and promotions aren’t a right—you have to
										earn them.<br><br>
										Here are some ideas to put you on the fast track:
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										» Do your job, do it well, and meet your deadlines.<br>
										» Ask “How else can I help?” and take initiative to fix problems you see.<br>
										» Sport a good attitude; no one likes to work with a whiner or a grouch.<br>
										» Get along with your boss and co-workers so they want to work with you.<br>
										» Go to your boss with solutions instead of only sharing problems.<br>
										» Keep an updated list of your accomplishments, skills, training, and
										certifications.<br>
										» Find a mentor, someone with more experience than you who can give you
										advice and guidance.<br>
										» Join a professional association for your industry.<br>
										» Raise your visibility by volunteering for companywide projects.<br>
										» Look for ways to add job responsibilities.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										And of course, never stop learning. You’ll have to compete with people who are
										more experienced or willing to work for less money. Whether you learn on the
										job or in the classroom, you’ll gain back the investment many times over during
										your career.

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										You may think of the clothing store when you see the word “gap,” but employers
										see a red flag. Once you start working full time, a long break between recent
										jobs
										or since your last job makes potential employers wonder if you’re unreliable, or
										if
										your skills and knowledge are out of date.<br><br>
										People have employment gaps for many reasons—some reasons are common,
										such as ending a summer seasonal job to return to school, or being laid off from
										a job due to lack of work. On the other hand, it can be uncomfortable to explain
										a
										gap if you stopped working because you impulsively quit a job for a petty reason
										or were fired.<br><br>
										How long is too long? If the gap between jobs was within the past few years and
										lasted more than four months, give a short, truthful explanation. Add anything
										you did during that time that would be relevant to the position you are applying
										for. Smart job hunters will keep three things in mind to explain the
										gap:<br><br>
										<b>Never lie.</b> The skeletons in your past are just an Internet search or
										background
										check away. It’s far better to ’fess up to your mistakes and explain what you’ve
										learned from them than to make up a story that you think sounds better.<br><br>
										<b>Never blame someone else.</b> Even if your boss was Cruella De Vil, your
										co-worker
										was harassing you, or you were unfairly passed over for promotion, skip the tale
										of
										woe—because no one wants to hire a whiner. Instead, focus on the positive: your
										skills, experience, accomplishments, and can-do attitude.
