									number of equal payments by a specific payoff date.<br><br>
									Installment loans are often used for big-ticket items such as a car or home. If you
									want to borrow more money or change the loan terms, you must take out a
									new loan.

									Avoid paying high interest and fees by comparing interest rates when borrowing
									cash. Getting a cash advance from your credit card or a payday loan is typically

									On the way home, Mariah asks her mom how long a credit report is because Frank

							<div class="col-12">
								<p class="paragraph">
									Her mom explains that Frank probably just checked a <b>credit score</b>—a three-digit

									responsible borrower.

								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-12">
								<p class="paragraph">
									But it took a lot of time and discipline for Mariah’s mom to build a strong history
									that will score well. She fell behind on everything after college, which put her in a

									And if they do let you borrow with a subprime score, they make you pay for it with

								<h3 class="floatLeft">THE CREDIT GRADING SCALE</h3>
							</div>

							<div class="col-12">
								<p class="paragraph">
									Many lenders choose to use scoring as a tool to help them predict if a borrower
									will repay what is owed and pay on time. The score gives a lender an indication of
									a borrower’s creditworthiness based on credit history data.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-12">
								<p class="paragraph">
									The contents of your credit report at a specific time are used to calculate credit
									scores. As your history is updated and changed, your credit scores will be
									recalculated based on the current facts at that point in time.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-12">
								<p class="paragraph">
									What’s a “good” score? That depends on the scoring model used by the lender to
									measure risk for a specific lending purpose, and, most importantly, what factors in
									the credit history most impacted that risk.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div class="col-12 mb-5">
								<p class="paragraph">
									So, rather than focusing on a specific number, look at where your history falls in
									the range of risk and the factors that affected your score. If your scores are low,
									focus on what you need to change in the way you use credit. No matter which
									scoring model is used, your risk level and your risk factors will be fairly consistent.

									There’s no 100 percent, surefire way to protect yourself from identity theft and

									<b>Defend5</b> strategy to reduce your chances of becoming a victim. (You can also find
									additional tips in Module 5: Financial Services.)

									» Bank account numbers<br>
									» Passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs)

									they had a “bad feeling” but ignored it because they
									didn’t want to seem “silly.” Protecting yourself is never
									silly. If a person, website, email, or situation seems

									Here’s how to stop them in their tracks:<br><br>
									» <b>Stay mum.</b> In your profiles, don’t list your real birth date, mailing address,
									or anything you use as a password or to answer a security question for your
									financial accounts.<br>
									» <b>Become a control freak.</b> Use privacy settings to limit the personal information
									people outside your network can see.<br>
									» <b>Pick a strong password.</b> Hackers pretending to be you can scam your friends.
									Create a non-obvious password that includes a mix of numbers, symbols, and
									letters (both capitals and lowercase).<br>
									» <b>Stay cautious.</b> Messages sent via social networking sites may be even less
									secure than typical email when it comes to viruses, malware, and fraudulent
									links to scam your information.<br>
									» <b>Just hit “ignore.”</b> If you can’t bring yourself to reject a stranger’s “friend”
									request, just ignore it. Scammers will quickly move on to someone else.<br>
									» <b>Watch your apps.</b> Facebook and other social sites do not screen new apps for
									security issues and viruses. Search an app’s name online before adding it, to see
									if there are any reported problems.

									<b>4 Pay as much as you can, as early as you can.</b> This reduces your overall
