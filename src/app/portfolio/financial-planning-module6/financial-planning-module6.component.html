										Her jaw drops as she glances at a medical bill one day. “They charge that much for

									<b>Insurance</b> reimburses you for unexpected losses or damages caused by a
									specific set of hazards (such as illness or fire) to a specific thing (such as a car or
									your life)—for a fee, of course. But that fee (aka <b>premium)</b> is only a fraction of the
									potential payout.<br><br>
									For example, renters’ insurance to protect $20,000 worth of your possessions may
									cost you just $200 a year. How can insurers afford to do this?<br><br>
									<b>Insurance companies are numbers ninjas.</b> They know the exact odds of each
									and every customer’s need for an insurance payout during the year. And they pool
									small payments from millions of customers to cover the big payouts that only a
									few will need.

									Insurers are on the ball. They know that if they pay 100 percent of each loss, some

									fake thefts, disabilities, and car accidents, or even burn down their houses to get
									new ones.<br><br>
									So, insurers make sure that you share in the financial burden by requiring you to

									» <b>I</b>nsurable interest—There must be the potential for you to have direct financial

									» <b>S</b>pecific loss—Any potential loss must have a definite time, place, and cause.
									This means being able to show evidence of the loss. Examples: a police report
									for a car accident or a doctor’s bill for medical care.<br>
									» <b>U</b>nintentional and unexpected—You can’t buy flood insurance as the hurricane
									approaches or purposely smash your own car to collect insurance money.<br>
									» <b>R</b>easonable cost—Risks that are too high, too trivial, or too frequent would

									you’re stuck paying the full

									3. <b>The lender says so.</b> Your car or home can be seized by a lender for
									repayment of your loan. Lenders don’t want to lose their investment, so they
									insist on certain levels of coverage.<br><br>
									Suppose you’re unable to get to work because you can’t afford to fix your car after

									expenses, could you afford to pay your bills? In fact, mountains of medical bills

									Before you can be a savvy insurance
									consumer, you need to crack the code on a
									few common terms.<br><br>
									» An <b>insurance policy</b> is a legal contract
									between an insurance company and
									the <b>policyholder</b> buying the insurance.
									It details what is covered and what is
									excluded, as well as any conditions
									for coverage.<br>
									» The <b>coverage limit</b> is the maximum
									amount the insurer will pay for losses,
									which is described in the policy. Any
									loss above the covered amount is
									your responsibility.<br>
									» The <b>conditions</b> spell out what the insurer
									won’t pay for. Examples: A health insurer
									might not pay for certain cosmetic
									medical procedures, such as a nose job
									or tattoo removal. Conditions also spell
									out what you must do to get payment
									for a loss. For example, you may have to
									notify your health insurance company in
									advance about an upcoming, scheduled
									hospital stay.

								<p class="paragraph">
									As of 2014, all Americans are expected to have health insurance. With few
									exceptions, people who aren’t insured will pay a penalty. And they take
									on risk for unexpected medical care fees. Paying expensive costs--such as
									ambulance service or x-rays—can make a mess of anyone’s spending plan.<br><br>
									If you can’t get insurance through an employer-based plan, shop for
									insurance options at the health care marketplace (aka exchange). Find
									out more about the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act at
									<b>www.healthcare.gov.</b>

							<div class="col-12 mt-3 mb-5">
								<p class="paragraph">
									Going without health insurance is like playing Russian roulette with your health,
									your bank account, and your life:<br><br>
									» Skipping checkups means you’re more likely to miss early detection of diseases
									like depression, diabetes, or scoliosis.<br>
									» Delaying doctor visits when you’re sick allows simple ailments to morph into
									something serious. And serious diseases can quickly become advanced before
									you’re diagnosed. The sicker you are, the more days of school and work you’ll
									miss. This can add financial strain.<br>
									» Unexpected mishaps—like Katie’s torn ligament or Jamie’s asthma—can put
									your finances into a tailspin, piling onto your already stressful situation.<br><br>
									! Your body and mind have to last the rest of your life.
									Don’t gamble with your health!

								<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										Health insurance is simple to understand once you
										know the jargon.<br><br>
										As you know, a <b>deductible</b> is the amount you
										pay before insurance kicks in. You may have one
										deductible for all your medical expenses or one
										for different parts of your health plan—for routine
										care, hospitalizations, and prescription drugs,
										for example.
									</p>
								</div>

								<div class="col-sm-12 col-md-12 col-lg-6">
									<img src="../../../assets/jpaFinancialPictureModuleSix/healthBenefits.png" alt="healthBenefits" width="100%" onContextMenu="return false;" />
								</div>

								<div class="col-12 mt-3">
									<p class="paragraph">
										You have to pay the deductible amounts every
										year; there’s no carry-over from one year to the next.
										Typically, you will pay lower premiums for plans with higher deductible limits.<br><br>
										Your health insurance company will split the bills with you.<br><br>
										» <b>Co-pays</b> mean you pay a set dollar amount upfront for a health care service,
										such as $15 for each office visit with a doctor.<br>
										» <b>Co-insurance</b> means you pay a set percentage of the charge. For example,
										70/30 means the insurance company pays 70 percent and you pay 30 percent.<br><br>
										For insurance purposes, everything you pay for medical care aside from the
										insurance premium is an <b>out-of-pocket expense.</b> Luckily for policyholders most
										plans cap out-of-pocket expenses with an <b>out-of-pocket maximum</b> for the year.<br><br>
										Let’s say your maximum is $3,000, and you’ve already spent $1,800 out of pocket
										this year as shown in Figure 6.3. If you then got a medical bill for $10,000, the most
										you’d have to pay is $1,200. The insurance company would take care of the rest.

										your monthly spending plan.<br><br>
										There’s a triple bonus: HSA deposits are tax deductible,
										withdrawals used to pay for health care expenses are tax free, and
										high-deductible plans typically have reduced premiums.

									Although insurance is a bargain compared with the disaster alternative, it can take
									a bite out of your wallet. Here are a few general cost-cutting strategies:<br><br>
									» <b>Aim high.</b> The higher your deductible is, the smaller your premium will be. Just
									make sure you realistically can afford the deductible you select.<br><br>
									» <b>Be like Goldilocks.</b> Given how much everything costs these days, the
									minimum level of coverage may not be enough. But you probably don’t need
									the highest level, either. Find what’s “just right” for you.<br><br>
									» <b>Ask for a discount.</b> Most auto insurers offer discounts if you have a clean
									driving record for the past few years, an anti-theft device, and good grades
									while you’re a student. Bundling two or more types of policies with one insurer
									may earn you across-the-board discounts.<br><br>
									» <b>Get proactive.</b> Driving responsibly—avoiding tickets and accidents—is the
									single biggest thing you can do to reduce your auto insurance premium.
									Giving up smoking and participating in wellness programs may lower your
									health insurance premium. Ask your insurer what you can start doing now to
									save money at policy renewal time.
