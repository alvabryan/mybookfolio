								When you receive money, the first thing you should do is to set aside a specific
								amount for financial goals that you can’t afford on short notice—like prom, buying
								a car, or going to college. This “pay yourself first” (PYF) strategy is a way for you to
								plan ahead to regularly save portions of money over time. Eventually, your PYF
								fund will grow so you have enough money to later pay for a big-ticket item. (You
								can learn more about planning for a PYF fund in Module 1: Money Management.)<br><br>
								Use some of your PYF money to build an emergency fund so you’ll have a financial
								cushion to fall back on when unexpected things happen. A cushion is especially
								important because no one is immune from a sudden loss of income due to a job
								layoff or unplanned expenses such as car repair or replacing a lost cellphone.<br><br>
								An emergency fund also is important if you choose to work in an industry or
								profession where the amount you earn each month may vary a lot—like seasonal
								work, farming, selling on commission, or running your own business. Not having
								cash on hand when there are shortfalls can add unwanted stress to your life.

								Unlike with stock values, you have some control over a property’s value. You can

								For instance, your risk tolerance is probably highest for investments you’ve chosen

								For closer goals, like college, you may prefer less-risky, steadier investments.<br><br>

								Inspired by her uncle’s story, Whitney texts him and asks if he knows any hot

								account in the next year before college.<br><br>
								He says he’d be happy to talk to her about investing, but her goal isn’t realistic.
								He explains that it takes time for investments to grow. That’s why he holds on to
								stocks for at least five years. To make the kinds of returns she wants in a year, she’d
								have to take some crazy risks and get wildly lucky to make it happen. She’s more
								likely to lose a bunch of money instead.<br><br>
								He says that if Whitney wants to start investing, he’ll teach her what he knows. He
								suggests that she start by investing 10 percent of each of her paychecks in stocks
								of some stable but growing companies. But the rest of her money should probably
								go into a CD that pays an interest rate that’s both higher than what her savings
								account pays and compounded more often. Whitney agrees to look for a CD, and
								they set up a time to talk after her next payday.
